For this assignment we had to create a timed quiz that would bring each question up one at a time and store the players highest score.

I began by following the logic given to us and started to work on each function. There is a function for for quiz to start, for each question to come up one at a time, for the timer to begin, to recognize the correct answer and for the uiz to end. 

I made alerts to let the user know if he or she has answered correctly or incorrectly. When the user hit start quiz, the quiz begins and a timer of 60 seconds starts to countdown. Then when the user selects an answer, an alert pops up. Once they press ok, then the next question appears.
If the user selects the wrong answer then 5 seconds is deducted from the time allotted for the quiz. Once the user answered the last question then the quiz is over and presents the user with a high scores page where they can submit their high score with their initials.

I'm not sure i was able to get the local storage to work properly.
